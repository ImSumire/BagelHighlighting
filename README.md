# Bagel Language Support for Visual Studio Code

**Bagel** is a deliciously re-stylized version of OCaml, infused with the familiar syntax flavors of C++ and Rust. This language is designed to bring the best of these worlds together, allowing you to write expressive and efficient code with a fresh syntax. The Bagel language is compiled to OCaml.

This extension provides comprehensive support for the Bagel programming language in Visual Studio Code, offering syntax highlighting and in the future snippets, code folding to enhance your development experience.

## Features

- **Syntax Highlighting**: Full syntax highlighting support for Bagel's unique syntax.

<u>In the future:</u>

- **Snippets**: Handy code snippets to speed up your development.
